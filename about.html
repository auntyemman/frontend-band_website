            The Molecules was formed at a performing arts summer camp called French Woods Festival in New York. 
            In 1994 the band known today as Maroon 5 was a Los Angeles, California grunge band.  
            The members were singer Adam Levine, guitarist Jesse Carmichael, drummer Ryan Dusick, and bassist Michael Madden.

            In 1997, the group signed with Reprise Records and released the studio album The Fourth World. 
            In 2001, James Valentine (guitarist) joined the band. In 2006, Dusick left the band. Matt Flynn replaced him as drummer. 
            The band's first album using the name Maroon 5 was Songs About Jane, released in 2002.

            On June 22, 2011, the group released the single "Moves Like Jagger" featuring pop singer Christina Aguilera. 
            The release was in promotion of the NBC show The Voice. The song became #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. 
            Levine won the first American season of The Voice in June 2011 with his partner Javier Colon. 
            The band said that they would be working on a fourth studio album released before 2012. 
            A song titled "Life After you" was expected to be recorded and released in early 2012. 
            A song titled "Wipe Your Eyes" was leaked on the web January 15, 2012 and is said to have been produced by music producer J.R. Rotem.
